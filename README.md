Project Name: Abyss Maker

Abyss Maker is a a real-time currency exchange rate checker that provides users with fast and accurate results. Abyss Maker allows users to check the latest currency rates of 168 currencies, with features like historical rates, filtering results, full currency code names. This website makes use of the free subscription API by fixer.io. 

## Design Process
This website is for anyone who are interested in checking out currency rates for any purposes. For example, they can be interested because they may be going on a holiday trip and want to convert some money to their destination's currency, or maybe it could be their interests. 

I designed the website to make it look simple and organised, so that users would not have to go through complex processes just to use my website.

## Features
Historical Rates
Allows users to check past currency rates all the way back to the year in 1999.

Filtering results
Allows users to select a currency code from the dropdown menu and get the results displayed in the form of a table.

Full currency code names
Allows users to see the full names of the currency codes in the form of a table.

I also added a feature whereby users can see the results of the that was request sent.('<strong>Results: </strong> <br> Success: ${success} <br> Timestamp: ${timestamp} <br> Base: ${base} <br> Date: ${date})

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used
Bootstrap
Jquery

## Testing
I looked through many tutorials on how to use the fetch method to retrieve data from the API I selected. The tutorials were all very complexed and asked Ms Dai for help. She then showed me the example for random user api. I refered to it and I managed to get it to work. 

I also looked through the documentation given by fixer.io to see how I can make the most use out of their free subscription. In the end, I managed to use all of their free features, like historical rates, search by specific currency symbols, etc.
